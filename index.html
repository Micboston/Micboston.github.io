        <h3 class="post-title">Coronavirus</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>
            This coronavirus is causing more than COVID-19.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is changing the world's behavior. Lets hope not for a social
             disease, the least.
          The life style and economy have already changed and who can really
           forsee the chain effect
        it will be left to deal with after the storm is gone?
      </p>
<p>
  Chinese government has been accused of hiding important facts and numbers to avoid panic.
          Italians are living in panic mode on the account of number of victims
          that now surpasses the numbers in China.
          Brazilian news on social media and chat groups show the concern about
           the side effect on the economy and how the
          misinformation also can potentially cause damages other than the virus
          and the disease perse.
        </p>
        <p>
           There is a lot of conversations and actions towards not getting
           contaminated, and too little about how the progress
          on treatment and cure for both the virus and disease are at these days,
          so the numbers keep going up. If it is time for all of us to do their
          parts, for some of us (health professionals) this part is more than a
          preventive common sense of matter. It is a choice, it is a career, it
           is a passion, it is
          a way of living and therefore it is an obligation. Speak up!
        </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand the subject has also brought up some good in people as
         well, so it can not be all bad, right? Only this time it seems to be PRETTY "bad".<br>

          You can be happy forever, says Mauricio.
          But forever is not everyday, Brian agrees.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is ok to feel sad sometimes and
          happy as you can be.
